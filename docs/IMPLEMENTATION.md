# PartSelectAgent Implementation Summary

## Overview

The PartSelectAgent is a LangChain-based agent designed to handle user queries about refrigerator and dishwasher parts. It uses a combination of rule-based and LLM-based intent classification to route user queries to the appropriate tools.

## Key Components

### 1. Intent Classification System

The agent uses a multi-layer approach to intent classification:

1. **Rule-Based Classification**: First, we use regex patterns and keyword matching to determine the user's intent.
2. **Problem Indicator Detection**: For queries that might not match the rule-based patterns, we look for problem indicators like "not working" or "making noise" to classify queries as "diagnose" intent.
3. **LLM-Based Fallback**: When rule-based classification returns "out_of_scope" but the query seems relevant, we use the Deepseek LLM to provide a more accurate classification.

### 2. Tool Architecture

The implementation includes two types of tools:

1. **LangChain-Compatible Tools**: Standard LangChain tools that inherit from BaseTool and implement the required interfaces.
2. **Simplified Tools**: Due to compatibility issues with Pydantic validators in some environments, we also implemented simplified tool wrappers that don't rely on Pydantic inheritance but maintain the same interface.

Each tool is designed to handle a specific intent:
- `SimpleProductLookupTool`: For finding parts by part number or description
- `SimpleCompatibilityTool`: For checking if parts are compatible with specific appliance models
- `SimpleInstallationGuideTool`: For providing installation instructions
- `SimpleErrorDiagnosisTool`: For diagnosing appliance issues and suggesting parts

### 3. Conversation Context Management

The agent maintains conversation context to handle follow-up queries:

1. **Context Tracking**: After each query, the agent updates its conversation context with relevant information like part numbers, model numbers, and appliance types.
2. **Context-Dependent Query Detection**: The agent can detect when a query is likely referring to previous context (e.g., "How do I install it?").
3. **Query Enhancement**: For context-dependent queries, the agent enhances the query with information from the conversation context.

### 4. Asynchronous Design

The implementation uses asyncio for better performance:

1. **Async Clients**: AsyncCatalogClient and AsyncDocsClient for database operations
2. **Async Tool Execution**: Tools implement `_arun` methods for asynchronous execution
3. **Parallel Processing**: The agent can run tools in parallel if needed

### 5. Error Handling

Robust error handling is implemented throughout the agent:

1. **Exception Handling**: All tool execution is wrapped in try/except blocks
2. **Fallback Responses**: If a tool fails, the agent provides a helpful fallback response
3. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Design Decisions

### Simplified Tool Architecture

We chose to implement simplified tool wrappers because:
1. Standard LangChain tools had issues with Pydantic validation in some environments
2. Simplified tools are easier to understand and modify
3. They maintain the same interface but with less complexity

### Conversation Context Tracking

We implemented conversation context tracking to handle follow-up queries because:
1. It provides a more natural conversation flow
2. It reduces the need for users to repeat information
3. It makes the agent feel more intelligent and helpful

### Integration with Deepseek LLM

We chose Deepseek for LLM-based intent classification because:
1. It provides high-quality intent classification with minimal tuning
2. It's easy to integrate with LangChain
3. It has good performance for this specific task

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Parameter Extraction**: Using a dedicated NER model for better extraction of entities
2. **Multi-Turn Reasoning**: Adding multi-turn reasoning for complex queries
3. **Expanded Intent Support**: Adding support for order status and cart management
4. **UI Integration**: Creating a chat UI for interacting with the agent
5. **Real Database Integration**: Connecting to real product databases instead of mock data
